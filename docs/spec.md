# GPT-Line Admin Dashboard Repository Specification
**Service owner:** Full-stack / internal tools developer  
**Primary runtime:** Next.js 15  
**Primary role:** Provide the internal operations dashboard for support, monitoring, account management, live-call visibility, purchase inspection, reconciliation, and auditability.

---

## 1. Mission

Build the production internal Admin Dashboard for GPT-Line. This repository must be sufficient for a developer to implement the entire admin surface without opening any other repository.

The finished dashboard must:

- authenticate internal operators
- provide a Hebrew RTL interface
- show dashboard summary cards
- show live calls
- show account balances and statuses
- allow blocking and unblocking accounts
- allow manual credit and debit adjustments
- show call history
- show purchase history
- allow payment reconciliation actions
- allow active-call termination requests
- keep a clear operator-friendly audit trail
- consume only the Core API and Payments service
- be ready for production deployment

---

## 2. Hard decisions already locked

Do not change these decisions.

- Framework: **Next.js 15**
- Language: **TypeScript**
- UI language: **Hebrew**
- Layout direction: **RTL**
- Auth method: **Firebase Authentication using Google Sign-In with explicit operator email allowlist**
- Data source for accounts/calls/summary: **Core API**
- Data source for payment views: **Payments Service**
- Browser must never talk directly to PostgreSQL or Redis
- All mutating actions must go through server-side route handlers or server actions
- Every operator action must be auditable

---

## 3. Users of the dashboard

The dashboard is for internal operators, not end users.

Typical tasks:

- inspect caller account by phone number
- see remaining balance
- see account status
- watch live calls
- manually credit or debit seconds
- inspect payment results
- retry payment reconciliation
- terminate an active call
- investigate why a caller could not connect

---

## 4. Required repository deliverables

The repository must include:

- Next.js app
- Firebase authentication setup
- page routing
- server actions or route handlers for mutations
- API clients for Core and Payments
- UI components
- tables and filters
- live data refresh/polling strategy
- tests
- Dockerfile
- `.env.example`
- README
- deployment docs

---

## 5. UX requirements

### 5.1 Language and direction

- all interface text in Hebrew
- full RTL layout
- phone numbers and numeric values must render clearly in mixed RTL/LTR contexts

### 5.2 Design principles

- clean operator-oriented layout
- fast search by phone number
- newest items first where sensible
- accessible contrast and readable tables

### 5.3 Refresh behavior

- live calls page auto-refreshes every 5–10 seconds
- detail pages may use manual refresh and/or polling

---

## 6. Required pages and features

### 6.1 Login / access control

Implement sign-in using Firebase Authentication with Google Sign-In.

Requirements:

- unauthenticated users are redirected to sign-in
- only allowlisted operator emails are authorized
- operator identity email must be available server-side for audit logging
- authentication must work with personal Gmail accounts
- authorization must be enforced server-side

Rules:

- Use Firebase Auth as identity provider
- Browser authenticates with Firebase client SDK
- Browser sends ID token to Next.js server route
- Server verifies token using Firebase Admin SDK
- Server checks normalized lowercase email against `ALLOWED_ADMIN_EMAILS`
- If allowed, server creates application session cookie
- If not allowed, deny access and destroy session
- Mutating actions must derive `admin_identity` from server session, never from client fields

### 6.2 Dashboard home

Show:

- current active call count
- total active accounts
- blocked account count
- recent purchases count
- recent failed purchases count
- quick links

Data source:
- Core `GET /admin/summary`
- optionally Payments for more detailed breakdowns if desired, but the required counts are available from Core

### 6.3 Live calls page

Show a table of active or recently active calls.

Required columns:

- `call_session_id`
- `phone_e164`
- `state`
- `started_at`
- `connected_at`
- `estimated_duration_seconds`
- `estimated_remaining_seconds`
- `ended_reason`
- terminate action

Data source:
- Core `GET /admin/calls`

Terminate action:
- server-side request to `POST /admin/calls/:call_session_id/terminate`
- confirmation modal required

### 6.4 Accounts page

Required columns:

- `phone_e164`
- `status`
- `remaining_seconds`
- `last_call_at`
- `lifetime_purchased_seconds`
- `lifetime_consumed_seconds`

Filters:

- search by phone number
- status
- pagination

Actions:

- details
- block
- unblock
- credit
- debit

### 6.5 Account detail page

Show:

- account summary
- remaining seconds
- status
- recent calls
- recent purchases
- recent ledger items

Actions:

- block/unblock
- credit
- debit

### 6.6 Call history page

Show:

- `call_session_id`
- `phone_e164`
- `started_at`
- `connected_at`
- `ended_at`
- `billed_seconds`
- `ended_reason`
- `state`

Filters:

- phone number
- date range
- ended reason if supported

### 6.7 Purchase history page

Show:

- `payment_session_id`
- `phone_e164`
- `package_code`
- `status`
- `provider_transaction_id`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`

Filters:

- phone number
- status
- package code
- date range

### 6.8 Payment detail page

Show:

- payment session summary
- package info
- provider result information
- event timeline
- reconcile action

### 6.9 Audit log page

If exposed by backend, show:

- operator identity
- action type
- target phone number
- created time

At minimum, dashboard mutations must always send or derive `admin_identity` server-side so backend audit logging is complete.

## 7. Backend API contracts consumed by this repo

### 7.1 Core summary

`GET /admin/summary`

**Example**
```json
{
  "active_call_count": 3,
  "active_account_count": 1250,
  "blocked_account_count": 7,
  "recent_purchase_count_24h": 16,
  "recent_failed_purchase_count_24h": 2
}
```

### 7.2 Core list accounts

`GET /admin/accounts?search=...&status=...&page=...`

### 7.3 Core get account detail

`GET /admin/accounts/:phone_e164`

### 7.4 Core block account

`POST /admin/accounts/:phone_e164/block`

**Request**
```json
{
  "reason": "support block"
}
```

### 7.5 Core unblock account

`POST /admin/accounts/:phone_e164/unblock`

**Request**
```json
{
  "reason": "support unblock"
}
```

### 7.6 Core credit seconds

`POST /admin/accounts/:phone_e164/credit`

**Request**
```json
{
  "seconds": 300,
  "reason": "support adjustment"
}
```

### 7.7 Core debit seconds

`POST /admin/accounts/:phone_e164/debit`

**Request**
```json
{
  "seconds": 120,
  "reason": "manual correction"
}
```

### 7.8 Core list calls

`GET /admin/calls?page=...&phone=...`

Response items must include live-call computed fields for active calls:

- `estimated_duration_seconds`
- `estimated_remaining_seconds`

### 7.9 Core get single call

`GET /admin/calls/:call_session_id`

### 7.10 Core terminate active call

`POST /admin/calls/:call_session_id/terminate`

**Request**
```json
{
  "reason": "operator terminated call"
}
```

The server-side admin route must attach verified `admin_identity` from session context.

### 7.11 Payments list payments

`GET /admin/payments?page=...&phone=...&status=...`

### 7.12 Payments get payment detail

`GET /admin/payments/:payment_session_id`

### 7.13 Payments reconcile payment

`POST /admin/payments/:payment_session_id/reconcile`

**Request**
```json
{
  "reason": "manual reconciliation retry"
}
```

Again, the server-side route must attach verified `admin_identity` from session context.

## 8. Client/server architecture requirements

### 8.1 No browser direct secrets

All backend credentials and service tokens remain server-side only.

### 8.2 API access pattern

Preferred pattern:

- Next.js server components for reads where practical
- route handlers or server actions for mutations
- central API client wrappers for Core and Payments

### 8.3 Error handling

UI must present operator-friendly Hebrew error messages without leaking backend internals.

### 8.4 Firebase auth session architecture

Implement the flow as follows:

- User clicks Google sign-in
- Browser authenticates with Firebase Auth
- Browser sends Firebase ID token to a server route
- Server verifies token with Firebase Admin SDK
- Server checks normalized email against `ALLOWED_ADMIN_EMAILS`
- If allowed, server creates application session cookie
- All protected pages validate server session before rendering
- All mutating actions resolve operator identity from verified server session

---

## 9. Required UI components

At minimum implement:

- layout shell
- authenticated page wrapper
- search bar
- filter bar
- paginated table
- status badge
- confirm dialog
- toast/alert messages
- loading state
- empty state
- detail panel / card list

---

## 10. Formatting rules

### 10.1 Seconds display

Wherever balances or durations are shown, display both:

- raw seconds
- human-readable minutes/seconds when practical

Example:
`887 שניות (14:47)`

### 10.2 Dates

Store UTC from backend, display in Israel local time in UI.

### 10.3 Phone numbers

Display full `phone_e164` in admin views because operators need the full number.

---

## 11. Security requirements

- all pages require authenticated session
- operator allowlist check must be server-enforced
- mutating requests require CSRF-safe implementation
- no service tokens exposed to the browser
- admin identity email must be attached to every mutating backend request from the verified server session
- session timeout / revalidation behavior must be documented

---

## 12. Configuration and environment variables

Provide `.env.example` with at least:

```env
NODE_ENV=development
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=replace_me
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=replace_me
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nreplace_me\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"

NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=replace_me
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=replace_me.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=replace_me
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=replace_me

ALLOWED_ADMIN_EMAILS=admin1@gmail.com,admin2@gmail.com

CORE_API_BASE_URL=https://core.internal
CORE_API_TOKEN=replace_me

PAYMENTS_API_BASE_URL=https://payments.internal
PAYMENTS_API_TOKEN=replace_me
```

---

## 13. Required tests

### 13.1 Unit/component tests

- RTL rendering
- status badge rendering
- confirm dialog behavior
- formatting helpers for durations and dates

### 13.2 Integration tests

- dashboard summary fetch/render
- accounts page fetch/render
- account block action sends correct backend payload with server-derived identity
- account credit action sends correct payload
- payments page fetch/render
- reconcile action sends correct payload
- live calls page polling behavior
- terminate call action sends correct backend payload

### 13.3 Auth tests

- unauthenticated redirect
- authenticated but non-allowlisted email blocked
- authorized operator allowed
